Welcome to the senior design project
â€“ deep learning sandbox!
 This project was created by 
four computer science students 
at Purdue University Fort Wayne,
 Jimmy Nguyen, Rodney McQuain, 
Vinamra Munot, and Jacob Mills. 
Moreover, the project was advised 
and sponsored by Dr. Zesheng Chen 
in the department of computer science. 
The goals of this project include
 implementing the applications based
 on latest deep learning technologies,
 understanding the advantages and limitations
 of deep learning,
 and building a demo for k to 12 students
 who are interested in computer science.
 The deep learning sandbox contains
 nine different applications:
 object detection in images,
 object detection in videos,
 real-time object detection, 
face emotion and landmark detection, 
face recognition in images,
 real-time face recognition, 
face mask detection, 
hand-written number detection, 
and voice cloning.
 As you can see, the applications 
can run on the different platforms such
 as desktop, mobile phones,
 and Internet-of-things devices.
 This is an amazing project!
 I highly recommend it to you!
