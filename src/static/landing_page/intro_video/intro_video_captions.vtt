00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.280
Welcome to the senior design project

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.960
the deep learning sandbox! This project

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.120
was created by

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.719
four computer science students at Purdue

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.279
University Fort Wayne - Jimmy Nguyen, Rodney McQuain, Vinamra Munot,

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.480
and Jacob Mills. Moreover, the project was advised

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.760
and sponsored by Dr. Zesheng Chen

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.039
in the department of computer science.

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.239
The goals of this project include:

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.360
implementing the applications based

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.879
on latest deep learning technologies,

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.559
understanding the advantages and limitations

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:50.640
of deep learning, and building a demo for K-12 students

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.840
who are interested in computer science.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.280
The deep learning sandbox contains

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.640
nine different applications: object

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.039
detection in images,

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:06.560
object detection in videos, real-time

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.799
object detection,

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.000
face emotion and landmark detection,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.040
face recognition in images,

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.479
real-time face recognition, face mask detection,

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.680
handwritten number detection, and voice cloning.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.799
As you can see the applications

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.000
can run on the different platforms, such

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.040
as desktop, mobile phones,

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.079
and internet of things devices.

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.520
This is an amazing project. I highly

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.680
recommend it to you.
